# Complex-function-visualization
This program is designed to help  visualize functions of complex variables. It displays two complex planes (input and output) and a grid representing complex numbers. Several preset functions can be selected, as well as a custom function that can be modified within the code. This program was written using the Processing software, which is based on Java.

For example, this is what f(z)=z^2 looks like:
![f(z)=z and f(z)=z^2](previews/z_squared.gif "f(z)=z and f(z)=z^2")

Here is f(z)=e^z (in color):
![f(z)=e^z](previews/exponential_color.gif "f(z)=e^z")

Here is f(z)=sin(z) and f(z)=tan(z):
![f(z)=sin(z) and f(z)=tan(z)](previews/sine_and_tangent.gif "f(z)=sin(z) and f(z)=tan(z)")
